I host SupeRails PRO videos on Vimeo.

It is great because:

- no youtube branding & ads => more premium feeling
- I don't have to think about hosting my videos & styling my player
- has basic security features, as "video can be viewed only on selected domains"
- fixed cost, not usage based like [MUX.com](https://www.mux.com/)

But having hundreds of videos in my library I want an easy way to import videos from Vimeo into my Ruby on Rails app.

I did not feel comfortable using an Vimeo API gems, but their own API is very good. **You don't need an api gem to use an API!**

### 1. Get a Vimeo API key

[Create a Vimeo app](https://developer.vimeo.com/apps/new)

Get an API key

Great! Now you can interact vie the API.

### 2. Use the Vimeo API with Ruby:

- [General Vimeo API docs](https://developer.vimeo.com/api/reference)
- [GET videos/:id](https://developer.vimeo.com/api/reference/videos#get_video)

```ruby
# bundle add faraday

ACCESS_TOKEN = Rails.application.credentials.dig(:vimeo, :access_token)

conn = Faraday.new(url: 'https://api.vimeo.com') do |faraday|
  faraday.request :authorization, 'Bearer', ACCESS_TOKEN
  faraday.adapter Faraday.default_adapter
end

# ping the API
response = conn.get do |req|
  req.url '/me'
end

body = JSON.parse(response.body)
user_path = body['uri']
# "/users/106009403"

# get list of all videos (25 per page)
response = conn.get do |req|
  req.url "#{user_path}/videos"
end

body = JSON.parse(response.body)
# get first video
video = body['data'].first
video['duration']
# 501 (seconds)

# get video by id
# https://vimeo.com/1021521307/832cd4eee7
response = conn.get do |req|
  req.url '/videos/1021521307'
end

raise "Failed to fetch video data: #{response.message}" unless response.success?

body = JSON.parse(response.body)
body['duration'] # 501 (seconds)
```

That's it! You can now get all videos, or get a video payload based on an ID.
