I never thought I would ever visit Bulgaria...

But here I am, enjoying Sofia, metting old and new friends!

I arrived a few days earlier to join my friend Adrian and his Avo ðŸ¥‘ team. They arrived a few days earlier to organize an Avo team building an a mini hackathon!

While they worked on Avo Calendar ðŸ¤« & other features, I worked on intergaring Embedded Stripe Checkout ðŸ’³ into an app.

On Tuesday we went out for lunch with our dear friend Nick and met Genadi, ther BalkanRuby organizer.

In the evening we visited the restaurant "Happy". This is a very popular chain in Bulgaria. Fast service and very tasty food!

Adomas, a friendly dane ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡° from Lithuania ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡¹ joined us. Apparently we have a few common aquanitances form ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡¹ (Kristina, Vidatmas, Vitaliia)

Thursday evening we went on a "free walking tour" around the city.

I was impressed by the natural hotwater fountain:

Next to the "Alexander Nevski cathedral" Adomas revealed the coolest Tshirt ever! Our allies are everywhere ðŸ˜Ž.

Day 1 of Balkan Ruby.

Irina Nazarova opened with a talk about making it as a consultancy.

My key takeaways:
1. Make your customers be irrational towards you.
2. Create opportunities fro customers and people around you.
3. #1 priority - be useful. #2 priority - make the deal

Afterwards we recorded S2E5 of Friendly Show with Irina! 

Adrian talked about Avo

Bozhidar Rubocop github sponsors



Day 2

Xavier Noria from Rails Core opened with the talk "A dateless mindset". 

Great way to structure work


Stephen SQLite


Radoslav - broad experience. I really like that each talk of his is unique


Nick, as the most experienced speaker with over 100 conference/meetup appearances, did a very entertaining closing talk about "monetizing Trailblazer".


Evening chat with Stas, Stephen





It is cool when a conference has a focus.

A business conference

WrocloveRB is very technical, BalkanRuby is more business focused

P.S. Stephen, I promise not to call you Steven ðŸ˜…
