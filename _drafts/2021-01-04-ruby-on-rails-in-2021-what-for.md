Here's how I see it
Don't take it as
My opinion can be biased.

In the 90s and early 00s, Ruby was just another good language.
Than Rails appeared as a great framework for Web Development.
(Web Development = Apps that run in the browser.)

App vs Website
App = Browser interface to interact with the database (read, write, edit, delete)
Website = Browser interface that does not necessarily need to have any interactive features.

Before 2007-2008 there were no smartphones.
All app were either installed on the computer, or could be run in the browser.
Computer and internet usage was growing, therefore Ruby on Rails was growing.

Than, Since 2007, the mobile usage caught up and overtook desktop usage.
Thus, the popularity of mobile grew and development manpower shifted there.

Around 2015 "Machine Learning" and "Big Data" became buzzwords, and python had the frameworks ready to serve this new trend.
Thus, manpower also shifted.

Why do I still love Ruby on Rails?

I don't like the idea of having the same product developed separately for Desktop, Android, iOs, 


Ruby on Rails in the future:

Ok, so it is a Web Development tool.
Who will use the web in the future?
Power users. Business.

B2C = mobile apps
B2B = web software

So, if you want to build B2B software, Ruby on Rails is a safe bet.

My wife uses only apps, never uses a browser.
