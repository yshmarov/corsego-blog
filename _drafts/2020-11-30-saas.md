General SaaS multitenancy boilerplate requirements:

User-Member-Tenant
User can log in.
User does not have to be a member of a tenant.
User can create multiple tenants.
User can switch from one tenant to another.
User can invite others to become members of a tenant.
Members are scoped under tenants.
There can be global and scoped models.
Scoped models have a tenant_id and can be accessed only if current_tenant is present.
Scoping is done on model and on controller level.
Roles and Authorization
Authorization is done current_user.has_role?(:admin, current_tenant, current_member).
User roles are scoped by tenant (you can be admin in one tenant and editor in another tenant)
There are three basic roles: [:admin, :moderator, :viewer]
When a user creates a tenant, he becomes tenant admin.
Tenant admin can:
edit tenant
invite members
delete tenant
access billing
manage user roles
When a member is invited, his default role is set to moderator (can do anything except actions that are exclusive to admins)
Viewer can only see tenant records
Billing
The billing is on tenant model (tenant belongs_to Plan)

Tenant can be set
by subdomain
by url (localhost:3000/tenant_id/projects)

Before we continue, I assume that you already have a basic understanding of Ruby on Rails and multitenancy.

We are going to use the gem acts_as_tenant.

Here's my current draft plan. It also explains how I envision a SaaS boilerplate:
Basics
set up environment
initialize app
clean up gemfile
gem haml-rails https://github.com/haml/haml-rails
install bootstrap https://railsbytes.com/public/templates/x9Qsqx
controller home index
devise for User
bootstrap navbar
messages partial
gem simple_form https://github.com/heartcombo/simple_form
user has to be logged in to access anything except home index
Members and tenants
scaffold tenants
scaffold members (joins users and tenants)
user - member - tenant relationships and validations
when a user creates a tenant, he becomes a member
my_tenants action - user can see a list of tenants where he is a member
Invite users to be a tenant member
gem devise_invitable https://github.com/scambra/devise_invitable
invite_member button - send email invitation to join a tenant
resend_invitation button
action_mailer - email to member when he is invited to tenant
gem acts_as_tenant https://github.com/ErwinM/acts_as_tenant
set current_tenant in application_controller manually
scope members by current_tenant
add tenant_id to users
button to switch tenant
??
Home#index always available
Members#index available only if tenant is set***
Tenants#index available even if tenant is not set***
??
Tenant belongs_to Plan
Roles and Authorization (pundit, rolify)
Upon tenant creation, the user is assigned admin role for this tenant.
Tenant admin can change roles of other tenant members. (owner/user)
Future ideas:
Add tests
Github/Facebook/Google oAuth
Add subdomains to tenants

SaaS

SaaS (Software as a Service) is a business model used by companies like Salesforce or Basecamp, Slack.

Subscription to use software

Types of SaaS:

·        personal B2C (you pay for your own account monthly) - Spotify, Netflix

·        team B2B (per user per month / per team per month) - Basecamp, Slack, Salesforce

From a technical perspective this provides two completely different challenges.

It's also 

Multitenancy Company/Account/Team

Paywall Billing Monthly Subscriptions

Secrets of multitenancy in Rails





I would summarize it this way:

If you want to build automated and scalable software, go for row-based multitenancy (many low-value clients).

If you want to build individual enterprise software, you can consider other approaches (a few high-value clients).

Theoretical foundation

 

Existing Ruby on Rails Software as a Service boilerplate applications:



Overall, a single-database multitenancy gem must:

·        give possibility to set current_tenant when needed

·        state which models should be tenanted and default_scope them by current_tenant

·        restrict access to tenanted models if no tenant is set

 

=> In my opinion, gem acts_as_tenant is the current best choice, because

·        database multitenancy is too complicated for most usecases

·        among row-based multitenancy solutions, acts_as_tenant offers the best amount of features

 

Existing Ruby on Rails tutorials about multitenancy:

I don't want to undermine the great work Chris and Rob did, but here are some things I don't like about these SaaS boilerplates:

·        Private

·        Somewhat expensive

·        Too much UI - what if I don't need tailwind, react or stimulus?

·        Too many non-related addons (social login)

·        Learning curve - it will take quite a lot of time to configure those boilerplates to your needs.

·        Questionable maintenance

In this tutorial we will try to build the ultimate basic open source Ruby on Rails SaaS boilerplate.

 

General SaaS multitenancy boilerplate requirements:

Multitenancy (scoping data & accessing it)

·        User-Member-Tenant tables

·        User can log in.

·        User does not have to be a member of a tenant to exist.

·        User can create multiple tenants. When a User creates a Tenant, he gets tenant admin role (through member).

·        User can invite others to become members of a tenant. When a user is invited into a Tenant, he gets tenant editor role

·        User can switch from one tenant to another.

·        Members are scoped under tenants.

·        There can be global and scoped models.

·        Scoped models have a tenant_id and can be accessed only if current_tenant is present.

·        current_tenant can be set by subdomain, url, session, current_user.tenant_id

·        Scoping is done on model and on controller level.

SaaS (users pay to use the software)

·        The billing is on tenant level (not user level)

·        Tenant belongs_to Plan
