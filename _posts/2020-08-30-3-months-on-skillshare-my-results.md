![3-months-on-skillshare](/assets/2020-08-30-3-months-on-skillshare-my-results/3-months-on-skillshare.png)

3 months ago I posted my course on Skillshare.

The Skillshare business model:

* Students pay a subscription fee of around $15/mo
* Teachers get paid based on how many minutes students watched their course videos (Skillshare courses are VIDEO-ONLY)

To see how well the course will sell organically, I did not do any promotion of the course myself.

Here are my results:

STUDENTS ENROLLED =

15 students "enrolled" into the course in 3 months.

EARNINGS =

The enrolled students watched 1,109 minutes of my video lectures, resulting in me earning a total of 29$.
29/1109=0,026 (2,5 cents per minute watched).

My course: "Ruby on Rails 6: Learn 25+ gems and build a Startup MVP 2020" 

Target audience: Ruby on Rails developers that want to advance their knowledge.

* [The course on Skillshare](https://www.skillshare.com/classes/The-Intermediate-Ruby-on-Rails-6-Web-Development-Course-2020-Learn-25-gems-and-build-a-Startup-MVP/141468652?via=search-layout-grid){:target="blank"}
* [The course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/draft/2519558/?referralCode=4721E9D437DEE1734159){:target="blank"}

LESSONS LEARNT =

* Skillshare is for video content only (think youtube premium)
* Each minute of video content should be "engaging" and unskippable (student drops out while watching one of your videos = you don't earn)
* Maybe not the best platform for tech courses (feels like it's more for "soft skills & design")
* Maybe not the best platform for organic growth (I'm growing MUCH faster on Udemy)

=> If you are a course creator/educator - sell courses, not minutes watched!

=> If you are an entertainer/animator - sell minutes watched!
