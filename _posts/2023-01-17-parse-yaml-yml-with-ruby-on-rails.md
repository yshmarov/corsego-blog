Instead of storing **static data** a database, you can create a structured YML or JSON file and parse it from your Ruby/Rails app.

I really like the data structure of a `.yml` file, because the syntax is much cleaner than `.json`.

Here's an example list of SupeRails episodes in the YAML format:

```yml
# db/view_data/superails-episodes.yml
- rank_number: 103
  title: "Ruby on Rails #103 Simple Omniauth without Devise"
  description: |
    Previously Iâ€™ve covered "Github omniauth with Devise".
    An even simpler solution would be to sign in via a social login provider (Github) without Devise at all! 
    Hereâ€™s the easiest way to create your whole social authentication solution from zero!
  tags:
    - omniauth
    - authentication

- rank_number: 102
  title: "Ruby on Rails #102 Email Calendar Invite"
  description: |
    In THIS episode we will EMAIL calendar invites and automatically add them to a users calendar!
    We will also handle updating/cancelling events!
  tags:
    - icalendar
    - email
    - action-mailer

- rank_number: 101
  title: "Ruby on Rails #101 iCalendar and .ics format. Add events to calendar"
  description: |
    Learn to create valid calendar events, that a user can download as an .ics file and add to his calendar!
  tags:
    - icalendar

- rank_number: 100
  title: "Ruby on Rails #100 Browser tab title notifications"
  description: |
    Do you like see the "new notifications count" in the LinkedIn browser tab?
    In this episode we will update the browser tab title, if the application user has new unsee notifications.
  tags:
    - hotwire

- rank_number: 99
  title: "Ruby on Rails #99 Hotwire: Search and Infinite Pagination (Ransack with Pagy)"
  description: |
    Implementing search or pagination is relatively easy, but it can get tricky when you try to combine the two, especially when you factor in some frontend. In this eposide we will learn to use gem Ransack for search, and gem Pagy for infinite scroll pagination.
  tags:
    - ransack
    - pagy
    - hotwire
```

You can parse this data (convert it into a Hash or Array) using Ruby on Rails **native yaml parsers**!

1. Parse a local YAML file with pure **Ruby**:

```ruby
require 'yaml'
path = "/Users/yaroslavshmarov/Documents/GitHub.nosync/superails-episodes.yml"
@episodes = YAML::load File.open(path)

@episodes.first.fetch('title')
# => "Ruby on Rails #103 Simple Omniauth without Devise"
```

2. Parse a YAML file inside a **Rails** app:

```ruby
# a controller action
  # @episodes = YAML::load File.open("#{Rails.root.to_s}/db/fixtures/superails-episodes.yml") # ruby way
  @episodes = YAML.load_file('db/fixtures/superails-episodes.yml') # rails way
  @episodes.inspect
```

Render the results in a view:

```ruby
# a view
<% @episodes.each do |episode| %>
  <%= episode.fetch('name') %>
  <%= episode['title'] %>
<% end %>
```

That's it! ðŸ¤
