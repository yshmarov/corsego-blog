[The Last Voyage of the Demeter](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1001520/)
Alien on a XIX century ship.
Not annoying, not too frightening. An easy watch.
7/10

[No hard feelings 2023](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15671028/)
Rich parents hire 32 year old bartender (Jennifer Lawrance) to have sex with their 19yo son.
Very funny comedy.
My wife and I couldn't stop watching!
10/10

[Barbie 2023](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1517268/)
Apparently the "feminism vs masculinity" can be funny and lighthearted!
The whole movie felt like going to an amusement park.
*Ken's will have as much power in Barbieland, as women have in the real world.*
A good watch.
9/10

[Strays 2023](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15153532/)
THIS IS NOT A MOVIE FOR KIDS!
Expectations were not high, but damn it was an amazing comedy!
Dog sex jokes are a thing!
If you treat your dog badly, you can lose your penis!
10/10

[The Flash 2023](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0439572/)
Just another superhero movie. Amusement park. The jokes were cringe.
Seeing the disgraced lead actor (Ezra Miller) on screen was not enjoyable.
I like amusement parks, but taking the same ride 20 times can get boring.
On the upside, unline Marvel movies, you don't have to watch 20 previous movies before understanding what's going on.
6/10

[The Little Mermaid 2023](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5971474/)
I grew up watchin the animated cartoon, and loved the songs.
There was some controversy online about casting yet another black actress for a role of a ginger.
In my opinion she played okay. Possibly she was cast for her good singing skills?
Anyway, the cartoon was more fun for me and after watching the movie I wanted to watch the cartoon once more.
The movie brings nothing new to the table.
4/10
