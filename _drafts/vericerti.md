1) Certificate design

Here is an example of an "unstyled" certificate: https://vericerti.com/certificates/08c8116262413d8b80a65571970f2114.pdf

If possible, please show me an example Wolters Kluwer certificate from any other event, so that I can style it appropriately.

2) Participant data

You need to fill in this CSV with participant information:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16E7aii66dQDdo4OmcGlqgnQI87F0LwG3tAxHY6tzbVE/edit?usp=sharing

Feel free to add judges, mentors, organisers too ðŸ¤©

Maximum number of certificates is not fixed.

When the CSV is filled, I will "generate" the styled certificates with QR codes, unique certificate IDs and unique URLs.

If you provide emails, the certificates will be automatically emailed to all recepients.

The certificates will contain all nessesary data for Linkedin "Licenses & certifications" ðŸ˜‰

3) Payment and service

I would suggest that Wolters Kluwer would pay a fee of PLN 444.

I can issue an invoice for that.

That would cover my service costs for Â±3 years (domain, hosting, certificate design).

That way I can also assure that the certificates will be online for 3 years from now, even if I decide to discontinue the "VeriCerti" business.

And surely, if you/Wolters Kluwer will want to use VeriCerti in the future, I would be happy to offer the most favorable conditions ðŸ˜Š
