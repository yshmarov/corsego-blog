I've been using AWS for couple of years now, spending around $10/mo primarily for Cloud9 and S3.

Now, that's not a lot but it's always nice to find ways to spend less. So I bumped into this program:

[AWS ACTIVATE](https://aws.amazon.com/activate/){:target="blank"}

![aws-activate-apply](/assets/2020-06-16-1000-in-aws-credits-for-startups/aws-activate-apply.png)

 I filled in the form and briefly described a startup that I'm working on, and a few days later such an email came in:

![aws-activate-money-received](/assets/2020-06-16-1000-in-aws-credits-for-startups/aws-activate-money-received.png)

When I logged into the AWS billing dashboard, this was already there:

![aws-activate-credits-received](/assets/2020-06-16-1000-in-aws-credits-for-startups/aws-activate-credits-received.png)

Well, $1000+$350 is a very pleasant bonus!
