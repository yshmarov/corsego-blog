### Beliefs. Life, love, death

* Is life worth living, if you have nothing to die for? When I was a kid, I dreamt of living forever and thought that there's nothing more important than life. My life. Now, as a husband, parent and citizen of a country fighting for survival, I have grown up. I believe that freedom, love and family are more important than life. There are things worth dying for. That makes life worth living.
* Without knowing of death you wouldn't value the time you were given to live.
* Sacrificing freedom for "peace" is the path to slavery. That's why we fight. Stand with Ukraine.
* Ideas are worth nothing. Implementation is everything.
