While @google emails are popular among tech startups, most corporations use Microsoft to manage their employees email addresses. These companies often want to enable their employees to single-sign-on to work-related services with their Microsoft account.

Previously I've written about setting up [**omniauth with Github**]({% post_url 2021-05-31-devise-omniauth-github %}){:target="blank"}.

Now, let's add a "**Sign in with Microsoft**" button:

![microsoft-oauth-login-button.png](/assets/images/microsoft-oauth-login-button.png)

After clicking the button, the user will be prompted to authenticate with one of his Microsoft accounts:

The approach is more-less similar for any omniauth provider. However I think the hardest part is navigating provider dashboards, getting valid API keys, registering your app, enabling the app in production ðŸ˜¬.

### 1. Get Microsoft oAuth API keys

First, create a [Microsoft Azure](https://portal.azure.com) account and connect a credit card. When I created my account, I was granted Â±200$ in credits for 1 year. That's enough to experiement with the platform.

![create microsoft azure account with free credits](/assets/images/microsoft-omni-register-0.png)

Find and open "*app registration*":

![microsoft-omni-find-app-registration-1](/assets/images/microsoft-omni-find-app-registration-1.png)

Click "*new registration*":

![microsoft-omni-register-app-2](/assets/images/microsoft-omni-register-app-2.png)

Input your app name;

**Important**: Select supported account types. When you are building a B2B app, often you will want to let only email accounts provided by an organization to access your app. This filters out some lurkers and spies.

Redirect URI for localhost should be `http://localhost:3000/users/auth/azure_activedirectory_v2/callback`

![microsoft-omni-add-callback-3](/assets/images/microsoft-omni-add-callback-3.png)

Success! You've created an app! Now you see your `client_id` for omniauth:

![microsoft-omni-application_client_id](/assets/images/microsoft-omni-application_client_id.png)

Generate a `client_secret`. Copy the **value**.

![microsoft-omni-application_secret_value](/assets/images/microsoft-omni-application_secret_value.png)

I suggest storing them in Rails credentials as:

```yml
microsoft_oauth:
  client_id: b810ccfa...
  client_secret: hGb8Q...
```

### 3. Configure your Rails app

If you don't want to use devise, see how to add [omniauth without devise]({% post_url 2023-01-09-omniauth-without-devise %}){:target="blank"}.

Here we assume that **you already use Devise**. 

First, install the [gem "omniauth-azure-activedirectory-v2"](https://github.com/RIPAGlobal/omniauth-azure-activedirectory-v2):

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem 'omniauth-azure-activedirectory-v2'
gem 'omniauth-rails_csrf_protection'
```

Add the generated API keys to your app:

```ruby
# config/initializers/devise.rb
config.omniauth :azure_activedirectory_v2,
  client_id: Rails.application.credentials.dig(:microsoft_oauth, :client_id),
  client_secret: Rails.application.credentials.dig(:microsoft_oauth, :client_secret)
```

Afterwards, it's the same process as for any other omniauth provider:

```ruby
# app/models/user.rb
devise :omniauthable, omniauth_providers: [:azure_activedirectory_v2]
```

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
devise_for :users, controllers: { omniauth_callbacks: 'users/omniauth_callbacks' }
```

```ruby
rails g migration add_oauth_attributes_to_users provider uid
rails db:migrate
```

```ruby
# app/controllers/users/omniauth_callbacks_controller.rb
class Users::OmniauthCallbacksController < Devise::OmniauthCallbacksController
  def azure_activedirectory_v2
    data = request.env['omniauth.auth']['info']
    @user = User.where(email: data['email']).first
    @user ||= User.create(
      email: data['email'],
      password: Devise.friendly_token[0, 20],
      provider: request.env['omniauth.auth']['provider'],
      uid: request.env['omniauth.auth']['uid']
    )

    if @user.persisted?
      flash[:notice] = 'Welcome!'
      sign_in_and_redirect @user, event: :authentication
    else
      flash[:alert] = I18n.t 'Authentication failed, please try again.'
      redirect_to new_user_registration_url, notice: @user.errors.full_messages.join("\n")
    end
  end

  def failure
    redirect_to root_path, alert: 'Authentication failed, please try again.'
  end
end
```

```ruby
# app/views/devise/shared/_links.html.erb
<%= button_to "Sign in with #{OmniAuth::Utils.camelize(provider)}", omniauth_authorize_path(resource_name, provider), method: :post, data: { turbo: "false" } %>
```

That's it!
