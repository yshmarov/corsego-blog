I'm often asked why I use HAML for my projects.

2 Reasons:
* easier to read than HTML.ERB
* easier to write than HTML.ERB
* wide adoption: some time ago [I did a poll on **r/rails**](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/gs0x4b/htmlerb_vs_htmlhaml_vs_htmlslim_which_one_do_you/){:target="blank"} to see it's pupularity. Results:

![haml-vs-erb](/assets/2021-01-04-rails-erb-or-haml/haml-vs-erb.png)

Clearly, HAML is a modern and popular choice for web development with Ruby on Rails 6.

P.S. VERY useful websites that help converting bulk code to/from haml, that I use on a daily basis:

* [htmltohaml.com](https://htmltohaml.com/){:target="blank"}
* [haml2erb.org](haml2erb.org/){:target="blank"}
