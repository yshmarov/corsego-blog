Here's how I see it<br />Don't take it as<br />My opinion can be biased.<br /><br />In the 90s and early 00s, Ruby was just another good language.<br />Than Rails appeared as a great framework for Web Development.<br />(Web Development = Apps that run in the browser.)<br /><br />App vs Website<br />App = Browser&nbsp;interface to interact with the database (read, write, edit, delete)<br />Website = Browser interface that does not necessarily need to have any interactive features.<br /><br />Before 2007-2008 there were no smartphones.<br />All app were either installed on the computer, or could be run in the browser.<br />Computer and internet usage was growing, therefore Ruby on Rails was growing.<br /><br />Than, Since 2007, the mobile usage caught up and overtook desktop usage.<br />Thus, the popularity of mobile grew and development manpower shifted there.<br /><br />Around 2015 "Machine Learning" and "Big Data" became buzzwords, and python had the frameworks ready to serve this new trend.<br />Thus, manpower also shifted.<br /><br />Why do I still love Ruby on Rails?<br /><br /><ol><li>I don't like the idea of having the same product developed separately for Desktop, Android, iOs,&nbsp;</li></ol><br /><br />Ruby on Rails in the future:<br /><br />Ok, so it is a Web Development tool.<br />Who will use the web in the future?<br />Power users. Business.<br /><br />B2C = mobile apps<br />B2B = web software<br /><br />So, if you want to build B2B software, Ruby on Rails is a safe bet.<br /><br />My wife uses only apps, never uses a browser.<br /><br /><br /><br />
