RIP
Raise your hands,
who has ever committed to an open source repo
who maintains an open source repository
who taught at least 1 person to write in Rails
who motiveted at least 1 person to become a Rails dev

Fake: "if more people become RoR developers, labor price will fall"
True: "if more people don't become RoR developers, RoR dev's will not be needed"

Like social media platforms, Languages are in a battle for more users

differrence between junior and senior - open source contribution; teaching others

A language needs a constant inflow of new users to survive and to prosper.

People and companies writing work only in hidden code to enterprise repos do not benefit society. They are just consumers.
The fundamental technologies that you use are open source...

- teach offline courses
- contribute to open source repos
- take ownership of unmaintained repos
- help on stackoverflow
- be loud on youtube, etc
- free youtube live RoR advice sessions
