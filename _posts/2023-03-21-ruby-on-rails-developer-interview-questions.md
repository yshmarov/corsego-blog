#### 14 General Ruby on Rails interview questions:

Here are some good and timeless questions that I have been asked when applying for jobs. I like these questions, because they don't go too much into tiny details, but can demonstrate the interviewees **range of knowledge and opinions**. I myself also ask these questions when hiring:

1. What is the difference between Ruby and Rails?
2. Did you try any other Ruby frameworks?
3. What don't you like about Rails as a framework?
4. What are the limits of Ruby on Rails?
5. Do you prefer Rspec and Minitest? What is the difference?
6. What do you think about TDD?
7. What are service objects? Have you used them?
8. Give an example of inheritance?
9. On a previous job, what was the development process like?
10. How do you review a pull/merge request?
11. What are background jobs? When would you use them?
12. Do you agree with the "fat model, skinny controller" principle?
13. What is a polymorpic association?
14. In Ruby, what is the difference between proc, bloc and lambda?

#### 7 Hotwire interview questions:

Hotwire is quite a fresh technology that was released in December of 2020, but these question can let you easily distinguish a PRO from a wannabe:

1. Give an example of a reusable and non-reusable StimulusJS controller
2. When would you use `initialize`, or `disconnect` in StimulusJS?
3. What is the difference between Turbo Frames and Streams?
4. What is the difference between HTTP and Websocket Turbo Streams?
5. Can you mix turbo frames and streams?
6. Give an example of a custom turbo stream?
7. When would you use a ViewComponent instead of a partial?
