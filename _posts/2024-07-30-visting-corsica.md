This year we went for vacation to Corsica by car.

We boarded a ferry im Nice. It took us 6 hours to arrive in Île Rousse in Corsica. There were some restaurants aboard the ship. The views were great.

**Tip: pay for a room. It's worth it.**

Over the course of our journey we stayed in a different city/hotel each night.

Initially we wanted to stay in campings, but it was too hot!

**Tip: Don't go to Corsica in summer. It is too hot in the day. Next time I would go in April or late September.**

Also, going south is not worth it. Stay in the North!

I also highly recommend the hotel [LANGLEY RESORT NAPOLÉON BONAPARTE](https://www.langleyhotels.eu/en/our-hotels/resort-napoleon-bonaparte/). Their food, service & location are great! 

Hope this small guide helps!
