I like contributing to my community.

In the Ruby community, some contribute by creating their own gems, or by contributing to existing projects.

I rarely contribute code, but I do raise issues when I see something's not working right.

My main contribution has always been knowledge sharing: creating educational courses, blogposts, screencasts.

Today, 9.5 years since I installed Ruby for the first time, I created my first Ruby gem.

[**gem hotwire_native_rails**](https://rubygems.org/gems/hotwire_native_rails) generates a lot of helpers and defaults, that make retrofiting an existing Rails app to a Hotwire Native Rails app much faster. It works smoothly on new Rails apps. Please check it out and tell me what you think!
