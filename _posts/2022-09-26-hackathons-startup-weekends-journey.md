**I have a hobby: visiting hackathons and “startup weekends”.**

Over the last 5 years I’ve participated in ~15 events (and won ±7 of them)

**How hackathons/startup_weekends work:**

1️⃣ on Friday you gather a team, decide on an idea, start work. Each event usually has a “theme” (legaltech/medtech/fintech/fashion etc.)

2️⃣ on Saturday you work on the idea, get feedback from mentors

3️⃣ on Sunday you prepare the MVP, the presentation, and finally pitch the idea on stage; possibly win a prize!

… and on Monday you most likely never come back to that idea 😵

**Some project highlights that I’ve worked on:**

🏅 **sunorwind/gRoof, 2017**

It was organized as part of Nasa Space Apps Challenge.

That was my first victory!

**Why do I keep participating???**

I think that visiting hackathons is a great way to 🤝 **get acquainted** with like-minded people, 👩‍💻**try to create something** over weekend, 💡 **validate ideas**, 🎤 **pitch practice**. 

🎉 It’s always a fun experience to live through!

If you’re interested in this kind of experience - Here’s a [**📅 calendar of startup weekends**](https://www.techstars.com/events#search_events=Startup) around the globe.

With love, Yaro 🐻
